Feature: Concept Relation

  Background:
    Given connection has been opened
    Given connection delete all keyspaces
    Given connection does not have any keyspace
    Given connection create keyspace: grakn
    Given connection open schema session for keyspace: grakn
    Given session opens transaction of type: write
    # Write schema for the test scenarios
    Given put attribute type: username, with value type: string
    Given put attribute type: license, with value type: string
    Given put attribute type: date, with value type: datetime
    Given put relation type: marriage
    Given relation(marriage) set relates role: wife
    Given relation(marriage) set relates role: husband
    Given relation(marriage) set key attribute type: license
    Given relation(marriage) set has attribute type: date
    Given put entity type: person
    Given entity(person) set key attribute type: username
    Given entity(person) set plays role: marriage:wife
    Given entity(person) set plays role: marriage:husband
    Given transaction commits
    Given connection close all sessions
    Given connection open data session for keyspace: grakn
    Given session opens transaction of type: write

  Scenario: Relation can be created
    When $m = relation(marriage) create new instance
    When $a = entity(person) create new instance
    When $alice = attribute(username) as(string) put: alice
    When entity $a set has: $alice
    When $b = entity(person) create new instance
    When $bob = attribute(username) as(string) put: bob
    When entity $b set has: $bob
    When relation $m set player for role(wife): $a
    When relation $m set player for role(husband): $b
    Then relation(marriage) get instances contain: $m
    Then relation $m is null: false
    Then relation $m has type: marriage

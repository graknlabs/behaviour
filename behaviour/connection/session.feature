Feature: Connection Session

  Background:
    Given connection has been opened
    Given connection delete all databases
    Given connection does not have any database

  Scenario: for one database, open one session
    When connection create database:

    Then session is null: false
    Then session is open: true
    Then session has database:
      | grakn   |

  Scenario: for one database, open many sessions

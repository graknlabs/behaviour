Feature: Type Generation Resolution

  Background: Set up keyspaces for resolution testing

    Given connection has been opened
    Given connection delete all keyspaces
    Given connection open sessions for keyspaces:
      | materialised |
      | reasoned     |
    Given materialised keyspace is named: materialised
    Given reasoned keyspace is named: reasoned

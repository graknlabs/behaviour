  # TODO: re-enable all steps when fixed (#75)
  Scenario: when evaluating negation blocks, global subgoals are not updated

    The test highlights a potential issue with eagerly updating global subgoals when branching out to determine whether
    negation conditions are met. When checking negation satisfiability, we are interested in a first answer that can
    prove us wrong - we are not exhaustively exploring all answer options.

    Consequently, if we use the same subgoals as for the main loop, we can end up with a query which answers weren't
    fully consumed but that was marked as visited.

    As a result, if it happens that a negated query has multiple answers and is visited more than a single time
    - because of the admissibility check, answers might be missed.

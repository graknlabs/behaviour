    /*

     Outline:

     Goal: given a keyspace, verify basic integrity checks are preserved, building up from very low level structures


     Schema:
       * create sets:
         * Type
         * sub
         * transitive closure of sub, sub_trans
         * Type_attr, subset of type with (t, attribute) in sub_trans -- plus Type_entity and Type_relation
         * has: (Type, Type_attr)
         * key: (Type, Type_attr)
         * plays: (Type, Role)
         * relates: (Type_relation, Role)
         * abstract: Type
       * functions (?)
         * label, datatype, regex

       *The goal is to create and verify these from the simplest building blocks, asking every possible combination at each
       step to create a valid pair for a set. The sets are then created and checked for validity.

       * As we build up the sets, each pair must be confirmed by Grakn, then the resulting relations are checked for logical integrity

     Data:
       * create sets:
         * Instances
         * isa
         * rel
         * has_data
         * key_data
       * functions:
         * id
         * val


      After building these (correct) sets, we use them to perform validation according to the conditions
      of validity for a data and a schema
